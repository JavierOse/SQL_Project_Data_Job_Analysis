# Background
I embarked on this project to refresh my memory and enhance my skills in SQL. To achieve this, I followed an in-depth SQL course on YouTube, which provided a comprehensive overview of the language. This course not only helped me regain my knowledge of SQL but also offered numerous opportunities to practice and refine my skills.

Moreover, this course provided valuable insight into the job market, assisting me in understanding the in-demand skills for a Data Analyst position. Throughout the course, I worked with a database that contained information about job postings, including job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. This practical experience was instrumental in developing my abilities and preparing me for the job market.

As a culminating task, the course presented this project, allowing me to showcase the work I accomplished and the skills I honed. If you're interested in following the same course, you can find it [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql).

### Here are the questions I answered through my SQL Queries:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills?

*I specifically tailored my analysis to meet my needs by focusing only on Data Analyst roles in California.*
# Tool Utilized
In this project, I utilized several tools to perform my analysis and manage my work effectively. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of each tool and its role in the project:

- **SQL**: I used SQL (Structured Query Language) to query the database and extract relevant information. SQL allowed me to filter, sort, and aggregate data to answer the specific questions I had about data analyst roles.

- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL served as the database management system for this project. It hosted the database containing job postings and related information. I executed my SQL queries on this platform to retrieve the necessary data.

- **Visual Studio Code**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) was my primary code editor for writing and testing SQL queries. Its features, such as syntax highlighting and extensions, made it easier to work with SQL and manage my scripts.

- **Git/GitHub**: Git was used for version control, enabling me to track changes and maintain different versions of my code. GitHub served as the repository to store and share my project, making it accessible for collaboration and showcasing my work.

By leveraging these tools, I was able to conduct a thorough analysis and present my findings effectively.
# My Analysis
